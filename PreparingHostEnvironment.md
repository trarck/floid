### Setting up a Linux build environment ###

As you are going to build Android you will need to follow the instructions from [Android OpenSource Project](http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html) to setup your Linux build environment.

If you plan to compile your own kernel image then you will need to install the uboot-mkimage package assuming that you use the recommended Ubuntu 10.04.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install uboot-mkimage<br>
